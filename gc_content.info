The GC-content is the percentage of nitrogenous bases on a DNA or RNA molecule that are either guanine or cytosine.DNA with higher GC-content is more stable than DNA with low GC-content due mainly to interactions
of base stacking of adjacent bases.There is a strong correlation between the prokaryotic optimal growth at higher temperatures and the GC-content of structured RNAs.With a long region of genomic sequence genes are often characterized by having a higher GC-content in contrast to the background GC-content for the entire genome.The shorter the sequence is the higher the AT bias.
